Achievo is a productivity application designed to help you organize your tasks efficiently. This README provides information on features, installation, usage, and how you can contribute to the project.

## Objective

The primary objective of Achievo is to provide users with a set of valuable tools and features that foster productivity, time management, and personal growth. Our application offers the following key components:

## Features

### Pomodoro and Todo Feature

Achievo incorporates the popular Pomodoro Technique to help you manage your time effectively and maintain focus during work sessions. You can create and organize your to-do lists, ensuring that important tasks are prioritized and completed efficiently.

### Eisenhower Matrix
The Eisenhower Matrix, also known as Urgent-Important Matrix, is a time management tool that helps users prioritize tasks based on their urgency and importance. It categorizes tasks into four quadrants:

- **Urgent and Important:** Tasks that need immediate attention. These are the top priorities.
- **Important, but Not Urgent:** Tasks that are significant but can be scheduled for later.
- **Urgent, but Not Important:** Tasks that are pressing but don't contribute significantly to long-term goals.
- **Not Urgent and Not Important:** Low-priority tasks that can be eliminated or delegated.

This feature in Achievo allows users to visually organize their tasks into these categories, providing a clear overview of priorities.

### 2. Motivational Spinning Wheel
The Motivational Spinning Wheel is a gamified element aimed at providing users with a fun and motivational experience. Users can spin the wheel, and it randomly lands on a motivational quote, tip, or a short task suggestion. This feature adds an element of surprise and encouragement to the task management process, fostering a positive mindset.

### 3. Milestone Setter
The Milestone Setter feature allows users to define and track significant milestones in their projects or personal goals. Users can set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) milestones. Achievo then helps users monitor their progress toward these milestones, providing a sense of accomplishment and direction.

### 4. 1-3-5 Rule
The 1-3-5 Rule is a task management technique where users set a daily plan with one big task, three medium tasks, and five small tasks. This feature in Achievo streamlines the planning process, helping users focus on a few key tasks each day. This approach promotes productivity by avoiding overwhelm and ensuring a balanced workload.

### 5. Analyze Your Day
The "Analyze Your Day" feature prompts users to reflect on their daily activities. Users can review completed tasks, identify challenges faced, and celebrate achievements. This reflective practice encourages self-awareness and continuous improvement by helping users understand their productivity patterns and make adjustments for better efficiency.

These features collectively enhance the user's task management experience by providing a comprehensive set of tools for prioritization, motivation, milestone tracking, and daily reflection.
